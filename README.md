# Basic Calculator in Python

## Overview

This project is a simple yet functional calculator developed as part of my internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project focuses on creating an intuitive user interface and ensuring robust input validation.

## Features

- **Addition**: Perform addition of two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Perform subtraction of one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication of two numbers.
- **Division**: Perform division of one number by another.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The calculator is designed with an intuitive graphical user interface using Python's tkinter library.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic input validation to handle errors and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **Main Program**: The main Python script (`calculator.py`) that initializes the calculator interface and handles user input.
- **Images Folder**: Contains the images used for the calculator buttons and background.
- **Resources**: A folder containing any additional resources required by the application, such as icons and background images.
